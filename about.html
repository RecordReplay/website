      <h4>Browser Architecture</h4>
      <p>Web Replay is the first browser that is capable of recording everything that happens on a web page, including all user/network interactions, all changes to the DOM and CSS, and all JS execution. </p>
      <p>Recordings can be saved to the cloud and replayed with complete fidelity: any bug can be traced back to its root cause with a powerful set of time traveling developer tools.</p>

      <h4>Open Source</h4>
      <p>Web Replay is built on top Gecko and Firefox and we believe in the principles of open source. Web Replay is available on <a href="https://github.com/bhackett1024/webreplay/">Github</a> and we welcome your feedback and contributions!.</p>

      <h4>Platform Support</h4>
      <p>Web Replay only runs on macOS. After the initial release we will focus on Linux and Windows ports. Web Replay currently supports 90% of browser functionality and is capable of recording sites like slack, gmail, and facebook. If you find a missing platform feature, please let us know.</p>

      <h4>Our Roadmap</h4>
      <p>Web Replay is currently undergoing alpha testing. Please email us if youâ€™d like to help test. A public beta will be ready by the end of February 2020, and we expect a release by the end of April 2020. Join our email list below for news and updates.</p>

      <h4>Privacy Policy</h4>
      <p>We respect your privacy, and minimize the use of your data. We do not analyze or process recordings in any way, except to replay them as directed by a user. We collect and retain logs of user sessions, which we analyze to fix bugs and improve performance. </p>
      <p>Logs are anonymized: they are not associated with the user who made them, and do not contain identifying information about the user or about the page being visited. We do not share any data externally and all communication with and between our servers is encrypted using TLS.</p>
