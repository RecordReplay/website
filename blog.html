      <h4>Instant Updates <div class="blogdate">April 2, 2020</div></h4>

      <p>We've been busy the last month making a bunch of stability and performance improvements to Web Replay.  We want Web Replay to be a joy to use, and for it to work great on complex, real websites before we start beta testing.  This process won't take forever; we're hoping to start beta testing later this April.</p>

      <p>Our development strategy is based on an end-to-end testing framework we've developed that simulates user sessions &mdash; for example, recording and interacting with a website, then rewinding to random places in the tab's execution and stepping around in random directions (this is similar to tools like <a href="https://www.selenium.dev/">Selenium</a>, though more tightly integrated with the browser's UI).  This framework lets us make sure that Web Replay works reliably (no crashes or other errors) on these sites, and lets us study the tool's performance in detail to make sure it is also reliably snappy.</p>

      <p>Performance is an especially interesting topic for a time traveling debugger.  Thanks to Web Replay's architecture, recording a tab requires only a little overhead, but rewinding through a recording and viewing the state at different places needs to be fast too.  There is a lot of machinery involved in jumping around between points in a recording, and it's natural to expect this to be slow compared to a traditional debugger.  This doesn't have to be the case; it's quite the opposite, actually.  When, say, stepping around in a traditional debugger, the program being debugged needs to unpause, run forward to the next place where it will pause, and then its state needs to be inspected and the UI updated to reflect that new state.  This typically requires hundreds of milliseconds of unavoidable CPU time and IPC delays.</p>

      <p>When using a time traveling debugger, this overhead is avoidable.  Before the step button has even been clicked, the debugger knows exactly where the program will pause after the step, and exactly what the program state will be at that point.  The information the UI needs can be precomputed, so that if the stepping button is clicked the UI will update instantly.  Doing this well requires care; we need to do as much computation in the cloud (with its massive parallel resources) as possible, and minimize the size of the precomputed data downloaded to the user's machine.  Still, this is within reach, and we'll be using our testing framework to make sure that instant updates like this are the norm when stepping or doing similar navigations with Web Replay.</p>
